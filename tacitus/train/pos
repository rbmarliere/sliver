diamond bottom breakdown or retest of $9850 though
When a diamond pattern is down in a downtrend
Short term I think buying pressure is weak and we need $9,200 to $9,300 range to excite buyers again. OBV short term bearish.
$BTC daily OBV also looking bearish. You usually want to see buying pressure picking up towards resistance not slowing down. Think a little pullback to $9.2k range would be a good place to get sellers to stop selling and momentum can reset.
Think there will be a correction wave incoming to wipe out a good chunk of retail profits.
$BTV OBV looking a lot more bearish now. Now that it broke down so sharply it's looking like a local top. Suggests that recent price action moving up will most likely come down.
Pretty weak buying action.
I'm scalping longs.
rekt signal
I wouldn't be shocked for a quick wick dip down to 9300
