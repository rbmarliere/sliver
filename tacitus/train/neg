Short term I think buying pressure is weak and we need $9,200 to $9,300 range to excite buyers again. OBV short term bearish.
$BTC daily OBV also looking bearish. You usually want to see buying pressure picking up towards resistance not slowing down. Think a little pullback to $9.2k range would be a good place to get sellers to stop selling and momentum can reset.
Think there will be a correction wave incoming to wipe out a good chunk of retail profits.
$BTV OBV looking a lot more bearish now. Now that it broke down so sharply it's looking like a local top. Suggests that recent price action moving up will most likely come down.

		RELEVANT SENTIMENT LIST

damn inverse btc looks so bearish wtf
Bears holding the line for now.
Days like today re-emphasize the importance of taking profit on the way up.
Not every chart will go your way every time.  Make sure to pay yourself before you can't.
This certainly won't be helping price any time soon.
Fed won't let BTC pump because Fed will buy BTC everytime it pumps with endless Fed money.
semi-bear market trendline while consolidating below key resistance
When the retest happens it's hard to admit it's a retest.
Maybe miners did dump on us
So daily levels are overbought
It‚Äôs scam wick weekend give us those $btc stop hunt moves not asking for much maybe $500 move both ways.
Stock market correlation BTC shorts will end up like Bakkt launch longs back in September 2019
give us some stop hunt wicks.
Let the chop chop $btc market continue
Expecting this for BTC.  Down before up again.
lower (9200) before higher imo (in my opinion)
Let the chop chop $btc market continue.
re-accumulate lower.
Think btc rallies into blue range where the confluence of MA200 and previous PA give a good chance of rejection and pullback.
Looks like sellers still in control
OBV still looks ready for a tumble. Might come come towards the end of the weekend.
Careful, they may try to shake us out one more time

NEUTRUAL SENTIMENT

Important conversations with claw.
Sometimes I see a tweet on CT that I‚Äôm like that would have 100K likes on normal twitter but it gets 37 instead because it can‚Äôt ever break out if this rat hole we all fell into years ago
Mask Off
You should only have 4 types of trades:  1. Big win 2. Small win 3. Breakeven  4. Small loss
A trader monitors every trade until it‚Äôs closed.  A clout chaser posts 10 coins a day. If 2 of them pump, he brags about it and people think he is a genius. The wrong tweets just get lost amongst 000s of tweets and he gets away with it.  This is the truth about CT!
Done !! Rookie the king üò≠

Be wary of the siren calls of certainty telling you what you want to hear. I've heard of people losing most of their capital due to investing with perceived experts in this space. Instead of 10% returns they were lucky if they got 10% of their capital back. Always hedge.üßê

Update:  Took a steroid today incase I have any inner ear inflammation.  Took an edible. Felt great, still a little dizzy but I was able to get some housework done this morning.  None of the maneuvers have been successful like usual. Chiropractor on Monday.
Maybe it's this ridiculous #bitcoin price action all week that's making me dizzy

The underlying financial system is coming to an end, marking the coming crisis to be a significant larger one than the 2008 and 2000 crisis.   The people can't be blamed, but they will pay the price. They always do.  That's why it's time to change and adapt.
Do you Remember this?  already 26 Months passed !!
This is a thread everyone should read.  /5 is thoughtful but the top threads are mint.  This is how I look at macro and price.  Spot the pockets of correlation and take advantage of them when they are presented.

Corporate debt is through the roof.  There's something I don't understand about the current situation.   Central banks created a system with de-leveraging phases (aka recessions) built into the system.  Credit allows for increased economic expansion, but..
