2020-05-09 20:50:24+00:00,davthewave,https://twitter.com/davthewave/1259224220715806720,Something like s2f essentially preaches to the choir. It can edify those who are already withing the church of Bitcoin. I doubt very much that it can bring in sober minded institutional money sitting on the side-lines and observing.
2020-05-09 20:50:25+00:00,davthewave,https://twitter.com/davthewave/1259224224792580096,s2f may actually have the effect of discouraging this more conservative money from coming in as s2f price predictions fail to materialize.
2020-05-09 20:50:25+00:00,davthewave,https://twitter.com/davthewave/1259224226789294086,What institutional money wants to see is realistic analysis. This is what the  logarithmic growth curve is directed towards. I think the big money is going to increasingly come in on the basis of seeing that price development further unfold.
