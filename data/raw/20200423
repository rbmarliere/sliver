Cos your wife is traveling. This is called a futures contract.
2020-04-23 13:48:44+00:00,thetaseek,https://twitter.com/thetaseek/1253319898517827587,"2/ Unfortunately, lockdown came and your wife will be home for the next 60 days.  You do not want this woman to show up at your house at all and try to pass this futures contract to someone else.  Only you cannot sell this commitment because nobody can receive the escort at home."
2020-04-23 13:48:44+00:00,thetaseek,https://twitter.com/thetaseek/1253319901705461768,So you will pay anyone just to take the girl off your hands.  Do you now understand why oil has a negative price when the contract is delivered?
