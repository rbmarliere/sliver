2020-04-04 18:15:30+00:00,AliceCrypt,https://twitter.com/AliceCrypt/1246501663654858752,@SalsaTekila I mean there's no debate over whether BitMEX is illegal in the US. The debate is whether they can use the IP filter as a get out of jail card from U.S. traders.   Any exchange allowing non ECPs to trade these type of instruments in the US is breaking the law.

Any exchange that allows US-based non ECPs to trade OTC derivatives is breaking US law.   The real question would be if BitMEX could be held liable for  US traders that used a VPN.
