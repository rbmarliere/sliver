It's of no use to know that the volume of Bitcoin in the last 24 hours was 1 billion USD. However, when combined with previous volumes and price action, it's helpful in taking a trade.  This is explained below."

An increase in volume denotes an increase in interest and buying/selling by holders of big funds (Institutions) AKA smart money.  Smart money are the holders of higher capital and more information.
2020-06-07 19:59:17+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1269720606368501760,"It's generally believed that smart money has access to better analysis and more info, hence the levels that see the higher volume is regarded as an area of interest.  Smart money moves in to buy/sell at a certain level, increasing the volume substantially."
2020-06-07 19:59:18+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1269720609560371201,"A lower level of volume sees buys/sells only from the retail investors with little capital, showcasing a period of weak hands buying and a time of uncertainty.  Conclusion- Higher volume= Smart money with more info and funds buying, hence it's an area of interest."

See the chart below, following a down-trend, there is a slight uptrend. Many traders would assume this to be a reversal. However this is accompanied by decreasing volume.
