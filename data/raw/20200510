We've now entered into the cloud and wicked back down just like in 2015. The correction was about twice as small but we have to keep in mind the market cap is about 20x as big right now. https://t.co/60aQKn4IWs
2020-05-10 09:09:30+00:00,DaanCrypto,https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/1259410224944947201,IF we were to correct 42% like in 2015 that would set us back to ~$5800.   In relation to the daily cloud this would set us way back below it and this would completely change the picture. Looking at the fractal i'd say there's a reasonable chance this was the dip for this move.
