The Range was sold on CB (Spot) and the bulls are swimming against the current, MM are likely using derivatives and fomo traders to offload their bags.

Take a look at this graph I've shared it many times in the past few weeks. The range is hot $9.2K to $10.5K nice R:R for both sides. Again I think the bulls will sweep $10.5 properly and then the hard rejection will come. https://t.co/hYo4xlAd3q

The accumulation period before that massive wick down on the 3k plus Bitstamp sell last year.  The accumulation period on this run up was about 2 weeks vs 140 plus days.

A reclaim of a weekly moving average is quantifiable and easy to backtest so you're not trading unprofitably off some arbitrary lines.
