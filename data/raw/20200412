2020-04-12 14:17:16+00:00,BitcoinTina,https://twitter.com/BitcoinTina/1249340813202657280,How many more #bitcoin OG's will keep burning their supply of #bitcoin so that others may buy it up cheap.  We need to celebrate these generous people who are willing to part with their bitcoin.  I hope most of them sell it all.  Seems few understand exactly why they own it.

I'd think we will get a pull back if we do manage to hit the $7600 levels. Have to take $7k first and then grind past some heavy resistances.  Could easily just be a bounce before lower lows.
