Meanwhile probably plenty of eager bidders who want a piece... I only got a partial fill on the last dip. I tend to think BTFD applies specifically to moments like these... just as it did the last little dip.

To me, Bitcoin is a store of value that doesn't require a third party."

There only being so many Bitcoin ever created is a very attractive thing and you don't have to trust anyone, it's all in the open source code. The ""monetary policy"" is known."
