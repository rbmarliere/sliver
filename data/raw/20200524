(CME Down time)  Purple line is the close price on Friday.   As you can see price usually just fluctuates around the purple line and closes the weekend about where it started. https://t.co/jXsoIOsFwf
2020-05-24 13:00:49+00:00,DaanCrypto,https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/1264541866017673216,"3) Since the purple line seems to act as some kind of magnet, could there be an edge to be taken when longing a price below and shorting a price above this CME close price?"
2020-05-24 13:00:49+00:00,DaanCrypto,https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/1264541867351379974,"4) Admittedly, whenever a huge gap is created over the weekend like we've seen past 2 weekends, this strategy would not be viable since price completely loses any attachment to the CME close price it may have had and just moves too far away for it to have an impact."

It is somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy though.   What do a lot of people do, holding shorts, when price is $100 from the gap and price starts going up?"

Therefore creating more buying pressure and filling the gap."

I know someone did an in-depth analysis on trading these gaps, which didn't work but i'm talking about JUST trading the price difference over the weekend before gaps are even created."
2020-05-24 13:00:51+00:00,DaanCrypto,https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/1264541872850075648,"8) Thinking if an indicator could be useful for this. Showing color coded ""pressure"" on price during weekends.   Something like this. Where a $100 (or 1%) up and down is in the green zone. $200+/- would be orange and $300+/- red.  Showing the further it deviates the more pressure https://t.co/RYTSv5KwCH"

Green could be seen as a no-trade territory.  Orange aggressive longs/shorts. Red long/short entries going by this strategy
2020-05-24 13:00:52+00:00,DaanCrypto,https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/1264541876453101570,10) I'll be looking into this further whenever i feel like it and see how it backtests to other weeks. One important thing to look into is at what price difference the impact of the CME close price doesn't seem to matter anymore. Personally thinking 3-4% but will have to see.
