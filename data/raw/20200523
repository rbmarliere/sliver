2020-05-23 19:47:02+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281707248791553,"3. I see so many people who draw lines with the hope of ""it bounces"" or ""it rejects"" here. It's nonsense.   The majority fail to see that what they trade is hope vs fact. It's narrative driven trading that usually results in failure."
2020-05-23 19:47:02+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281704333705218,"2. Systems  Having a system is essential. You need to understand the conditions in which you operate, what success factors you have, what the falldowns are.  It helps you to take position, plan invalidation, take profit and remove bias."
2020-05-23 19:47:03+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281709664768015,"5. But you don't know the results are because you don't track it. You dont know what works because you're off drawing some more lines on some shitcoin hoping it does a 10x. The approach is built on air, you dont know what works, you operate purely on thought."
2020-05-23 19:47:03+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281710889521153,"6. Being systematic, tracking results, analysing trades, understanding pitfalls, identifying when you can push trades harder, identifying when you need to reduce risk, increase risk, it's all information you can gather but you dont."
2020-05-23 19:47:03+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281708444160000,4. The reason is that you can make an argument about all sorts of confluent factors.  Horizontal S/R Diagonal trend line EMA confluence EW Count MACD levels  Literally anything can be used to give you confluence in your decision making. You see what you want to see.
2020-05-23 19:47:04+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281713724796930,"7. If you sit there night after night charting random shit, stop.  Start assessing your trade history work out why you took the trade, why did it fail? Why was it a success? Could anything have been done differently? How? Has that set up played out before? When? Results? Changes?"
2020-05-23 19:47:04+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281714865602567,"8. Being systematic about trading means you have data, data that lends itself to executing better trades. Charting on hope or expectation alone is lazy and isnt effective for the long run. Sure you'll win some, but why not identify why you won and replicate it?"
2020-05-23 19:47:05+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281720209235970,"11. If you can begin to nail trades in one market with a focused approach, why not take it to another market and test how it performs? I had this experience with equities into crypto, I had to adapt and change what I knew was effective in one to the new conditions present."
2020-05-23 19:47:05+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281717772300291,9. Trading one asset  Focusing on one asset helps with everything I described above. It helps to focus your mind on the approach and behaviour of a single market.  I started with BTC being my sole focus and then moved to ETH (crypto). SPX is my home for traditional.
2020-05-23 19:47:05+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281719093551112,"10. People worry they will ""miss out"" if they trade one asset. Right now I can probably take a guess that you're actually just losing more money because you're throwing it away in multiple markets vs one."
2020-05-23 19:47:06+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281722465726465,13. It's important to focus your time and energy into actually improving vs charting or recharting something randomly 50x because the one time you did get it right it felt great (but you cant remember why it worked or what the conditions were).
2020-05-23 19:47:06+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281721387745280,"12. Your single focus will absorb you into a deeper level of thinking with the asset in question. It will encourage repetition of behaviour and identification of the markets quirks and characteristics.  You're not missing out, you're looking to make money in your market."
2020-05-23 19:47:06+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281723585597441,"14. Put time in, focus your attention, start identifying what is working in your trading, dont take a scattergun approach.  Record everything. Highlight what works. Highlight what doesnt. Backtest. Dont stop journaling. Adapt."
2020-05-23 19:47:07+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281726492303360,"16. So make a change, new start, new opportunities, a chance to have your own system that tells you how to trade. No more hope and narrative, simply fact and execution."
2020-05-23 19:47:07+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1264281725280100352,"15. You have the option to become successful, your mindset has to be right and your approach has to be solid. Sitting and charting randomly time after time is holding you back, think of all the hours you could have spent being disciplined and analytical of your performance."
