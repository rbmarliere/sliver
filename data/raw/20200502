If this was a top then the distribution range should take time to develop (similar to the 10k - 13k range in 2018). It isn't wise to expect that we will simply retrace back to the lows immediately from here.   We could expect increased volatility however.  Fact.

I think we are due to a larger correction on HTF (95% we get to at least 7800). There is a chance we take 9400 first but in order to do that, we would definetly at least take one of those 5 untapped lows on LTF first."

Use the RSI to study the momentum of a price movement and whether its sustainable.   USE INDICATORS AS AN AID TO PRICE ACTION STUDY.  This needs a change in belief of your current mindset.
