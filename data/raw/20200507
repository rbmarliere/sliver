2020-05-07 05:53:47+00:00,CryptoLimbo_,https://twitter.com/CryptoLimbo_/1258273804662513665,#Ichimoku Kumo Breakout is one of the most used strategy when it comes to Ichimoku trading. But after trading Ichimoku I have noticed that not all Bullish Breakouts give a Bullish move up and not all Bearish Breakouts give a move down. This is what I learnt about Kumo Breakouts
2020-05-07 05:54:05+00:00,CryptoLimbo_,https://twitter.com/CryptoLimbo_/1258273882026491905,A good Kumo Breakout must have these things. 1) A Kumo Twist or Future cloud supporting the move i.e A Bullish Kumo Breakout must have Bullish Future Cloud and vice versa. 2) Kijun sen in equilibrium with the price. ( Kijun should follow price during breakouts)

In the 1 image the we see Two Kumo Breakouts but Future Cloud was not supporting it so it turned to be a fakeout. In the 2 and 3 image the Kijun was not supporting the breakout so it turned to be Fakeout. https://t.co/qcLSWp7JTr

(Fuck retests - play the break) Diagonal breaks (valid diagonals requiring multiple touches and reactions to have validity)
2020-05-07 18:10:37+00:00,ColdBloodShill,https://twitter.com/ColdBloodShill/1258459235744206853,"3. Utilise LTF - zoom in, not out  Look for opportunities when RSI (or your indicator of choice) has reset (returned to a mid point) and look to try and establish a position with trend continuation."

Longs: Look to TP when a high is taken (pay for your trade) then look for the next resistance to complete your position.  Shorts: Be aggressive in your TPs - if you get a sharp sell off, that's probably your chance - take it."

Those of you in the old school who believe this is a bubble simply have not understood the new mathematics of the Blockchain, or you did not cared enough to try.
