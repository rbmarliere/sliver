All my trade setups are on my feed. Do a little work and scroll through it and see if it fits your style.
2020-06-15 18:58:15+00:00,CryptoLimbo_,https://twitter.com/CryptoLimbo_/1272604349718388736,"2) Don't consider Trading or Crypto as a get rich quick scheme. It is a patience game. Keep risk management as your 1st priority. 3) Stop getting attached to your bag. You bought something, it went down more than you expected, Sell it, the market will always give you opportunity."
