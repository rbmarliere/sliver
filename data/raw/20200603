Price is either above them or below them (when price = moving average, defer to its position last time it wasn't).  That makes it easy to backtest. You can trade based on historic continuations after a crossover."

The run to 14k came off a ~130 day accumulation period.  The move to 10.5k came off a ~50 day accumulation period.  This recent accumulation period was less than 10 days.  Same with the SPX too.
