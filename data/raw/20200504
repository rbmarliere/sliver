You should't be trading if you don't have a system which has been back tested for at least a few years worth of data or as long as the asset has existed Back testing is easy and anyone can do it manually.  Back-test it on the asset of your interest as every asset is different.

Imagine we have 100 year sovereign bonds with 0% coupon issued at a rate of 0.25-0.5%.  Then have the Federal Reserve buy up most of the issuance. That bond is not deflationary in practical terms.
