2020-06-01 20:11:35+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1267549374361538566,"A thread on market capitalisation.   A lot of people making hyper bullish claims about Bitcoin going to $250,000 by next year and a few other unknown coins growing by 1000x and ripple going to 200-250.  Let us try to understand the possibilities and the probability behind it."
2020-06-01 20:11:36+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1267549377058357249,"What does it take for a coin to double in value? The market cap of the coin has to double.   If Bitcoin is trading at 10,000 with a market capitalisation of 100 Billion, you need another 100 billion to be injected into the market cap of BTC to double the price of one Bitcoin."
2020-06-01 20:11:36+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1267549379298095104,"So anyone claiming that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the next year, is actually claiming that we will reach a market cap of 4.5 trillion USD. (Considering 18 million supply)  That capitalisation is greater than the 4 largest Companies in the history of capitalism, combined."
2020-06-01 20:11:37+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1267549383995691009,Conclusion. An asset doubles in value if the total market cap doubles in value.  Market cap = Total supply of coins x Value of one coin.  Use this metric to make a rational decision about how much a coin can increase in value.
2020-06-01 20:11:37+00:00,EmperorBTC,https://twitter.com/EmperorBTC/1267549381730828289,"While we may get there someday, but within an year seems a bizarre preposition.  In the same manner, XRP getting to 200 USD would require injecting 8 Trillion USD into its market cap, which is almost half of USA's GDP. Highly unlikely in this lifetime, considering no use case."
