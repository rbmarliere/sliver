High leverage shouldn't be used every single entry since you have to expect to lose a decent amount of trades. Once you get good on 1-5m charts you can start finding entries with maximum R:R for high lev. I've set Phemex so my max available leverage is 20x. https://t.co/VFeSg2qeKv

No bearish divergence on the 6H and the next resistance isn't until the blue zone.
